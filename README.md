# knnclassifier

This is my first attempt at creating a knn classifier to classify whether a customer is likely to churn their credit card. Currently it has an accuracy of 92%.

To use this program, the user needs to have two csv files(churn.csv and churn_target.csv). The files also need to be formatted to have the correct headers for this program to run properly. Furthermore the user should make sure that the .csv files are in the same directory as the python file and the working directory for the interpreter is the location of the file. Alternately, the user can use the full file name path for the two .csv files.
